I’m currently working on an autonomous car called Herbie. I’m using an Arduino to control the car’s movement and sensors. The ultrasonic sensors on the front of the car are used to detect obstacles. The code for this project is written in C++ and can be [viewed on Github](https://github.com/ChimiSeanGa/Herbie).
