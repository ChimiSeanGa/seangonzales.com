[Newton fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal) are generated by the iterative process known as [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), which is a process for finding the roots of a polynomial. Depending on which initial point you choose, the result of Newton's method will give you a different root. The boundaries of the loci corresponding to each root are fractals, and the resulting images can be quite stunning.
