Domain coloring is a technique for visualizing complex-valued functions, that is, functions which take a complex number as input and return a complex number as output. Each point in the complex plane is assigned a color. A function f is drawn by coloring the pixel at the coordinates (Re(z), Im(z)) with the color assigned to the output f(z). Try it for yourself below!
