A Julia set can be drawn as a fractal in the complex plane by iterating a function f(z) at each point z and checking if the iterated value eventually exceeds some fixed bound. In the interactive applet below, we look at functions of the form f(z) = z^n + c. You can use the slider to change the exponent n, and by hovering your mouse over the applet you can change the value of the constant c.
